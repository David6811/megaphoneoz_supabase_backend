# megaphoneoz_supabase_backend

I am creating a react project integrate with supabase to implement a simple CMS system. This project is for the background of CMS.
It include react, typescript, effect.js, and material 3.
We would have tables like posts, comments which are assosiated with user's id.
The whole pages are more likely same with wordpress but more simple than it.
